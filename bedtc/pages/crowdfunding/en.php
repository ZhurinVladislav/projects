        We decided to follow a step-by-step approach and use the classic venture financing model instead of conducting an ICO,

    </p>
    <p>
        We proceed from the principle that it makes no sense for a company to receive millions of dollars without even having a working prototype. We avoid this approach! 
        We started slowly with small steps and developed not just a prototype, but a successful product with thousands of active users.

        This is a time-tested model that allows you to distribute risks wisely. The main thing is that our team gets maximum motivation for
